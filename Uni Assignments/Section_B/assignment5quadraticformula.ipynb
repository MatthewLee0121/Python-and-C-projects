    "Learn how to use Python to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥2\n",
    "+𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0, and handle different cases based on the discriminant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The general form of a quadratic equation is:\n",
    "𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "where a, b, and c are constants and x represents the unknown\n",
    "variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The solutions for x are given by the quadratic formula:\n",
    "𝑥 = -𝑏± sqrt(𝑏2 4𝑎𝑐)/2𝑎\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "        o 𝑏2 ―4𝑎𝑐 is called the\n",
    "        discriminant.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        o If the discriminant is positive, the equation has two real\n",
    "        solutions.\n",
    "        o If the discriminant is zero, the equation has one real solution.\n",
    "        o If the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real\n",
    "        solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a Python function solve_quadratic(a, b, c) that takes the\n",
    "coefficients a, b, and c as inputs and prints the real solutions if they\n",
    "exist. The function should:\n",
    "\n",
    "        o Calculate the discriminant.\n",
    "        o Determine the number of real solutions based on the\n",
    "        discriminant.\n",
    "        o If the discriminant is non-negative, calculate and print the\n",
